Hello!

My name is Diandra Simon and I'm a 31 year old mom from Florence, South Carolina. 
I graduated from Timmonsville High School from a small town outside of florence.
After finishing high school I attended the University of South Carolina where I 
majored in Marketing/Management and while there I studied in Costa Rica for 3 months. 
About two and a half years ago my interest in technology was peaked and I enrolled at 
a small college in Florence called Francis Marion where I majored in Management Information
Systems. I finished my second degree in December 2015 and now I'm working on pursuing a technical
career.
